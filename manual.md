# DetectAndRespondToPloutus.ps1

## Overview

`DetectAndRespondToPloutus.ps1` is a PowerShell script designed to detect and respond to Ploutus ATM malware. This script performs several key tasks:
- **Detection**: Identifies the presence of Ploutus malware by checking for known indicators of compromise (IoCs) such as malicious processes, files, and registry keys.
- **Response**: Takes appropriate actions including stopping malicious processes, removing malicious files, and cleaning up registry keys.
- **Notification**: Sends email notifications about detected and removed threats.

## Features

- Detects and stops malicious processes.
- Removes known malicious files and registry keys.
- Verifies file hashes to identify malicious files.
- Logs actions to a log file.
- Sends email notifications for critical events.

## Prerequisites

- **PowerShell**: Ensure you are running PowerShell with appropriate permissions.
- **SMTP Server**: Configure the script with valid SMTP server settings to enable email notifications.
- **Permissions**: The script requires sufficient permissions to terminate processes, remove files, and modify registry keys.

## Configuration

### SMTP Settings

Update the SMTP configuration in the `Send-Notification` function:
- `$smtpServer`: The address of your SMTP server.
- `$smtpFrom`: The email address from which notifications will be sent.
- `$smtpTo`: The email address where notifications will be sent.
- `$smtp.EnableSsl`: Set to `$true` to enable SSL.
- `$smtp.Credentials`: Provide valid credentials for your SMTP server.

### IoCs

Modify the following arrays to include known IoCs for Ploutus malware:
- `$maliciousProcesses`: List of known malicious process names.
- `$maliciousFiles`: List of known malicious file paths.
- `$maliciousRegistryKeys`: List of known malicious registry keys.
- `$maliciousSHA256`: List of known malicious file hashes.
- `$maliciousFileNames`: List of known malicious file names.

## Usage

1. **Update Configuration**: Edit the script to configure SMTP settings and IoCs as described in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in PowerShell with appropriate permissions.
   ```powershell
   .\DetectAndRespondToPloutus.ps1
    Monitor Logs: Review the log file located at C:\ATM_Security\PloutusDetectionLog.txt for details on actions taken.
    Check Notifications: Ensure email notifications are received as per the configured settings.

Functions

    Get-FileHashSHA256: Computes the SHA256 hash of a file.
    Stop-MaliciousProcesses: Identifies and stops known malicious processes.
    Remove-MaliciousFiles: Removes known malicious files by path.
    Detect-And-RemoveMaliciousFileNames: Searches for and removes files based on known malicious names.
    Remove-MaliciousRegistryKeys: Removes known malicious registry keys.
    Log-DetectionResponse: Logs detection and response actions.
    Send-Notification: Sends email notifications for critical events.
    Detect-And-Respond: Main function that coordinates detection and response operations.

Error Handling

The script includes error handling for:

    File hash computation
    Process stopping
    File and registry removal
    Email notification sending

Errors are logged to the log file with details on the issue encountered.
Security Considerations

    Permissions: Run the script with the least privilege necessary.
    Registry Access: Carefully validate registry paths to avoid accidental deletion of critical keys.
    Credentials: Securely manage SMTP credentials and avoid hard-coding sensitive information in the script.

Testing

Before deploying the script in a production environment:

    Test it in a controlled environment to validate functionality.
    Monitor performance and adjust as necessary to handle large filesystems or numerous processes.
