# Ploutus ATM Malware Detection and Response Script

## Overview

This PowerShell script is designed to detect and respond to the Ploutus ATM malware. It scans for known indicators of compromise (IoCs) including malicious processes, files, registry keys, and file hashes. The script performs actions such as stopping malicious processes, removing files and registry keys, and sending notifications.

## Features

- **Detects** malicious processes, files, and registry keys.
- **Computes** file hashes and compares with known malicious hashes.
- **Stops** malicious processes.
- **Removes** malicious files and registry keys.
- **Logs** detection and response actions.
- **Sends** notifications via email about detected threats and actions taken.

## Prerequisites

- PowerShell v5.1 or later.
- Appropriate permissions to execute process, file, and registry operations.
- SMTP server configuration for email notifications.

## Configuration

1. **SMTP Server Configuration**:
   Update the `$smtpServer`, `$smtpFrom`, and `$smtpTo` variables in the `Send-Notification` function with your SMTP server details.

2. **IoCs Configuration**:
   Modify the arrays `$maliciousProcesses`, `$maliciousFiles`, `$maliciousRegistryKeys`, `$maliciousSHA256`, and `$maliciousFileNames` to reflect the indicators of compromise relevant to your environment.

## Usage

1. Save the script as `PloutusATM_Malware_Detection_Response_v1.1.ps1`.
2. Run the script in PowerShell with administrative privileges.

   ```powershell
   .\PloutusATM_Malware_Detection_Response_v1.1.ps1

Security Considerations

    Run with Least Privilege: Ensure the script runs with the minimum required permissions to avoid potential security risks.
    Sensitive Data: Avoid exposing sensitive information in logs or notifications.
    Resource Management: Properly manage resources such as file streams and registry handles to prevent leaks or unauthorized access.

Logging

Logs are saved to C:\ATM_Security\PloutusDetectionLog.txt. Ensure this directory is secure and accessible only by authorized personnel.
