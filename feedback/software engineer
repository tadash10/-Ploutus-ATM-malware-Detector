As a senior software security engineer, my feedback will focus on improving security practices, code maintainability, and adherence to best practices. I'll then provide an updated version of the PowerShell script with the implementations and a README file in Markdown format.
Feedback on Script
1. Security Considerations

    Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure the script is executed with the minimum required permissions.
    Sensitive Data Handling: Avoid logging sensitive data. Make sure email configurations and other sensitive information are securely managed.
    Input Validation: Ensure any input is validated to avoid potential injection attacks or other security issues.
    Resource Management: Ensure proper management of resources such as file streams and registry handles to avoid leaks or unauthorized access.

2. Code Maintainability

    Modularization: Break down the script into smaller, reusable functions to enhance readability and maintainability.
    Error Handling: Implement robust error handling and ensure that errors are logged appropriately without exposing sensitive information.
    Performance Optimization: Optimize resource-intensive operations, like scanning large directories.

3. Logging and Notification

    Secure Logging: Implement secure logging practices to avoid exposure of sensitive information.
    Notification Security: Ensure email notifications use secure configurations and handle errors gracefully.
